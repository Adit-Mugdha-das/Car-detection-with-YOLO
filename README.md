# Car Detection with YOLO

This project implements a YOLO-based object detection pipeline to detect cars in images and videos using a pre-trained YOLO model.  
It is part of **Week 3 (Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks)** from the **Deep Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera.

## Description

In this lab, the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection model is applied to detect vehicles in road scenes captured from a car-mounted camera.  
The project includes:

- Loading a pre-trained YOLOv2 model
- Running object detection on static images and video frames
- Applying **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** to remove redundant bounding boxes
- Drawing bounding boxes around detected cars
- Visualizing intermediate steps such as anchor box assignments and class probabilities

## Important Note

To keep the repository lightweight and comply with GitHub upload limits:

- All large **video files (`.mp4`)** inside the `nb_images/` folder have been removed.
- The heavy **YOLO model weight files** inside `model_data/` have been removed.
- The `out/` folder containing generated outputs (predicted videos) has been deleted.
- Only essential PNG images used for explanations and architecture diagrams are retained.

**If you want to reproduce full outputs:**
- Download the YOLO pre-trained weights separately.
- Video prediction outputs will be generated by running the notebook.
